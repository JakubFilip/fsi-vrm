### Description
The project focuses on controlling multiple robots using the simulation tool RobotStudio ABB. The robot on
Table No.1 will communicate with another robot on Table No.2 using a conveyor belt. The main goal of the
project will be to create a sorting production line. A more detailed description of the project will be discussed
with the lecturer.

1. Pick transport object and place it on the conveyor belt.
2. Pick a color object and place it in the transport object (the color of the object is determined by the user).
3. Use the conveyor belt to move the transport object to the second robot.
4. Pick the transport object and place it in the shipping box.
5. Pick the box lid and place it on the shipping box.
